nodemcu-uploader.py
===================


A simple tool for uploading files to the filesystem of an
ESP8266 running NodeMCU as well as some other usefull commands.

It should work on Linux, Windows, and OS X; and with any type of file
that fits the filesystem, binary or text.


Usage
-----
--port and --baud are set to default /dev/ttyUSB0 and 9600 respectively.

###Upload
Uploading a number of files.

```
./nodemcu-uploader.py upload -f init.lua -f README.md -f nodemcu-uploader.py
```

Uploading a number of files, but saving with a different file name.

```
./nodemcu-uploader.py upload -f init.lua -d new_init.lua -f README.md -d new_README.md
```

###List files
```
./nodemcu-uploader.py --port com1 file list
```

###Format filesystem
```
./nodemcu-uploader.py file format
```

Todo
----
* Speed up the initial step of uploading the script to NodeMCU
* Implement a change of baudrate for the actual transfer and go back when done

Details
-------
This is *almost* an implementation of xmodem protocol for the upload part.

1. Client calls the function recv()
2. NodeMCU disables echo and send a 'C' to tell that it's ready to receive data
3. Client sends a filename terminated with 0x00
4. NodeMCU sends ACK
5. Client send block of data according to the definition.
6. Client sends ACK
7. Step 5 and 6 are repeated until NodeMCU receives a block with 0 as size.
8. NodeMCU enables normal terminal again with echo



### Data Block Definition
__SOH__, __size__, __data[128]__

* SOH = 0x01
* Single byte telling how much of the 128 bytes data that are actually used.
* Data padded with random bytes to fill out the 128 bytes frame.

This gives a total 130 bytes per block.

The block size was decided for...

1. Being close to xmodem from where the inspiration came
2. A fixed size allow the use of the uart.on('data') event very easy.
3. 130 bytes would fit in the receive buffer buffer.
4. It would not waste that much traffic if the total size uploaded was not a multiple of the allowed datasize.
